# TODO

Some items to implement one day.

 - [ ] you could make a float16 property to map a value over two DMX channels. Might help to fine-tune moving heads and create smoother looks? e.g: 180+16
 - [ ] You could convert your system to run off percentages. e.g: 0.0 - 1.0. Floats. so things are basically percentage based.
 - [ ] Multi-part fixtures (see https://support.obsidiancontrol.com/Content/Getting_Started/General_Concepts.htm). Might be handy for your LED Beam Bars to run different colors.

## Ableton Link

- [ ] You could integrate with this thing instead over TCP: https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/carabiner#carabiner

## Beat Library

- [ ] You could port this to Go: https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/electro/blob/main/src/main/java/org/deepsymmetry/electro/Metronome.java
